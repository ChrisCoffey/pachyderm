<article><h2>About</h2>
	<p>There are so many excellent tech blogs on the internet, so why am I writing yet another tech blog? Honestly, I'm doing this as a forcing function for my own thinking. The idea is that by publically presenting not only the finished product but also the process learning & creating it, I hope to clarify my own thinking.</p>
	<p>If other people find value in the process, that's even better, but its not my primary objective.</p>
	<p>As for me, I'm a programmer fascinated by typed functional programming. I also happen to be a father, rock climber, and engineering manager who works in startups.</p></article>
