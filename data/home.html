<article><h2>Foldl.io</h2>
	<p>Welcome to Foldl.io. This blog was written from the ground up using Pachyderm, a modern, albeit 100% experimental static site framework written in Haskell. If you find any bugs or oddities, please let me know or open an issue on the pachyderm repository.</p>
	<p>If you're interested in hiring me, you can find a copy of my resume on this site. That being said, I'm extremely satisfied with my current employer and would be unlikely to leave.</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p></article>
